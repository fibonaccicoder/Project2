Neuro boost app

This app is unique in the sense that it is more than a simple planner. It is designed using the principles from some of the world's most successful individuals (like Tony Robbins, Bob Proctor, Jack Canfield, Jim Rohn, and even Jim Carrey), following their routines that they attribute much of their success to.

It goes beyond keeping track of daily tasks, and actually leverages the brain's ability to create new neural networks in order to help the user design, and bring to fruition a fulfilling life that they truly love.

The morning routine is designed to be an hour long set of physical and mental exercises in order to kick start the user's day so they may enter it with full presence and power.
